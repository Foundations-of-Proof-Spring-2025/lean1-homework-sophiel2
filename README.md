This is a copy of a repository by Riccardo Brasca which is itself a copy of the original from Heather Macbeth.
Heather Macbeth's repo contains the examples and exercises that complete her book "The Mechanics of Proof"
We are using Riccardo Brasca's copy because it doesn't all the examples from Heather, not yet, and thus is a little less overwhelming, maybe, 
and hopefully I can add more examples through the semester
